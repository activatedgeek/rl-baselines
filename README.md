TorchRL provides highly modular and extensible approach to experimenting with
Reinforcement Learning. It allows for a registry based approach to running
experiments, allows easy checkpointing, and updating hyper parameter sets.
All this is accessible via a programmatic interface as well as a friendly CLI.

Objectives
-----------

* Modularity in the RL pipeline
* Clean implementations of fundamental ideas
* Fast Experimentation
* Scalability

Install
--------

```
$ pip install torchrl
```

This installs the `torchrl` package and the `torchrl` CLI.
